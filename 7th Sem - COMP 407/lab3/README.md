Sampling of Signal

1. Generate the signal x = 5sin(2 pi f t) with 5 cycles, where f = 2 kHz signal and sample the signal with
frequency 5 KHz, 10 Khz, 20 KHz. (Title and label each figure)
2. Generate the signal x = 5cos(2 pi f t) with 3 cycles, where f = 2 kHz signal and sample the signal with
frequency 5 KHz, 10 Khz, 20 KHz. (Title and label each figure)
